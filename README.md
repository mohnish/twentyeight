Mask your messages. Mix your messages inbetween news articles.

### Usage

- Type "facebook" without the quotes in the search field on the top and hit the "Contact Us" link beside it.
- This will take you directly to the secret messaging app that is embedded inside the camouflage app.
- Once you're done sending the messages, just click on any link on the navigation bar and BOOM. You're messages are hidden again.
- It's that simple ;-)
